RESTAURANT#GENERAL
 judging from previous posts this used to be a good place , but not any longer . we , there were four of us , arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude . they never brought us complimentary noodles , ignored repeated requests for sugar , and threw our dishes on the table . the food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny . after all that , they complained to me about the small tip . avoid this place !

RESTAURANT#GENERAL
 i was very disappointed with this restaurant . ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away . i had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish ive requested . food was okay , nothing great . chow fun was dry ; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family . i/we will never go back to this place again .

 i had my eyes on this place , promising myself i will one day 'give it a try . ' and i hate to say this but i doubt i 'll ever go back . the food is very average ... the thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet , every thing they serve is too sweet here . the only thing i moderately enjoyed was their grilled chicken special with edamame puree . i had never had edamame pureed before but i thought it was innovative and tasty ( could 've used a bit more salt ) . anyways , if you 're in the neighborhood to eat good food , i would n't waste my time trying to find something , rather go across the street to tamari . the decor is night tho ... but they really need to clean that vent in the ceiling ... its quite un-appetizing , and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern .

 we ate outside at haru 's sake bar because haru 's restaurant next door was overflowing . what 's the difference between the two ? their sake list was extensive , but we were looking for purple haze , which was n't listed but made for us upon request ! the spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome , great appetizer to share ! we went around 9:30 on a friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great !

FOOD#QUALITY
 i have eaten here a handful of times , for no reason besides sheer convenience . ( i hang out , and live , in the neighborhood.. ) the food is decent . however , it 's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth . i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect , which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me , i.e . make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water , or the check . i know , you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored , but my agenda is i 'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends , seeking a pleasant experience . well , i did n't find it there , and trust , i have told everyone i can think of about my experience . the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty . hmmm .

 the food here is rather good , but only if you like to wait for it . i like the somosas , chai , and the chole , but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing . the service varys from day to day- sometimes they 're very nice , and sometimes not . the kitchen however , is almost always slow . also , specify if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you do n't . the ambience is pretty and nice for conversation , so a casual lunch here would probably be best .

 the food here is rather good , but only if you like to wait for it . i like the somosas , chai , and the chole , but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing . the service varys from day to day- sometimes they 're very nice , and sometimes not . the kitchen however , is almost always slow . also , specify if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you do n't . the ambience is pretty and nice for conversation , so a casual lunch here would probably be best .

but when we looked at the menu , there were n't a lot of choices , most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section .

 i went there with my friend last saturday . first it took us a long time to find the place . we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant , then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers . but when we looked at the menu , there were n't a lot of choices , most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section . then we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi . those rolls were big , but not good and sashimi was n't fresh . they were dry and disgusting , i did n't even finish my first piece .

 first went here to enjoy their garden terrace . the food was amazing , and the service was prompt and helpful , but not over-bearing or rushed . the steak tartare is a great bet , they fix it for you at the table . admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm , but the open kitchen is part of the charm . great wine selection , gigondas is worth the price , and the house champagne is a great value . it may be a bit packed on weekends , but the vibe is good and it is the best french food you will find in the area . have recommended the place to friends , always gets good response .

 i grew up on these bagels . the staff is no nonsense . the food options rule . when i lived upstate for a while i would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else . worth visiting the 1st ave spot because it is the original store .

he served me an uni hand roll , which i never had before , and let me tell you ... it was heaven !
FOOD#QUALITY
 i stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two fridays ago when i was with two friends in town from l.a . being serious sushi lovers , we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action . i asked the chef what he recommends and he asked me if i like uni . ( for those of you who do n't know , uni is sea urchin in japanese , which happens to be my favorite . ) he served me an uni hand roll , which i never had before , and let me tell you ... it was heaven ! aside from the sea urchin , the chef recommended an assortment of fish including fatty yellow tail , boton shrimp , blue fin torro ( fatty tuna ) , sea eel , etc . the sake menu should not be overlooked ! all in all , this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city . try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll .

service was very good - prompt , attentive and non-intrusive .
SERVICE#GENERAL
 we visited orsay during ny restaurant week and tried their $ 35 menu . service was very good - prompt , attentive and non-intrusive . food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience ) . wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top . traditional french decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation .

i 've been to at cafe spice probably 5-8 times , it is probably still the best indian restaurant around union square .
RESTAURANT#GENERAL
 i 've been to at cafe spice probably 5-8 times , it is probably still the best indian restaurant around union square . to sum it up : service varies from good to mediorce , depending on which waiter you get ; generally it is just average ok . seating is always prompt , though the restaurant does fill up in the evening . food is usually very good , though ocasionally i wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders . as many other reviewers noticed , your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time . the decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall , which are great for a date .

 our first time in new york and we had to try a new york bagel . we were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem . the bagel was huge . they were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior . the workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese ( gets a little messy ) . i loved it and would highly recommend .

all the staff is absolutely professional ! !
SERVICE#GENERAL
 all the staff is absolutely professional ! ! i sometimes see the waiters do n't have enough knowledge of their dishes . but they do . ( that is a must , but not every restaurant can do ... ) if you want to dine with large party , i recommend to make reservation basement . there 's nice and quiet , small but enough for 6 ( or more ) .

this restaurant was way overhyped .
RESTAURANT#GENERAL
 this restaurant was way overhyped . my chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily . okay-i do n't mind the oily part ( cause most are cooked that way ) but it was way too bland . the scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary .

this is some really good , inexpensive sushi .
FOOD#QUALITY
 this is some really good , inexpensive sushi . it costs $ 2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll , but the roll more than triples in size , and that 's not just from the rice . the spicy tuna roll is huge and probably the best that i 've had at this price range . the yellowtail was particularly good as well . i have reservations about the all you can eat deal , however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu . in any event , this is a place i 'll be sure to stop by again when i 'm in this part of town .

 i 'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food . the hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed . service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great . do not try unless you 're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste .

 honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives . believe us , we 've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs . not sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly . the all-u-can-eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality . limited menu , no-so-fresh ingredients , thinly-sliced fish , fall-apart rice . the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce ( even its low sodium ) , the vinegar-soaked rice , and the scallion on top of the fish . the waitstaffs are nice though . wont come back again for sure !

 honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives . believe us , we 've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs . not sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly . the all-u-can-eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality . limited menu , no-so-fresh ingredients , thinly-sliced fish , fall-apart rice . the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce ( even its low sodium ) , the vinegar-soaked rice , and the scallion on top of the fish . the waitstaffs are nice though . wont come back again for sure !

 i have been to roth 's twice and both times were very disappointing . once for dinner and once for brunch . both times i was extremely dissappointed by the service , which was boarderline rude . they wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another . much of the time it seems like they do not care about you . the dinner was ok , nothing i would have again . i had their eggs benedict for brunch , which were the worst in my entire life , i tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was .

SERVICE#GENERAL
 i like cafe noir dont get me wrong , it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent ! ! the service was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served . the waitress , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing . after dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend , asked him : where are you from ... maybe you dont know how things work in america ... and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on . we did tip , i guess the model / waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager . the whole set up is truly unprofessional and i wish cafe noir would get some good staff , because despite the current one this is a great place .

 what a great place . i came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband . the ambience was so fun , and the prices were great , on top of the fact that the food was really tasty . i was n't thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes , but i guess that 's the price you pay for a popular place . i would definitely recommend sea if you like thai cuisine !

SERVICE#GENERAL
 i was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever . a gentleman , maybe the manager , came to our table , and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order . when asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants , he replied this is not mcdonald 's , every place makes things differently while it is understandable that every place is indeed different , there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude . the service was poor , restaurant poorly lit , staff not very attentive and i would have rather eaten at a mcdonald 's than this joint . never again !

i got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries .
FOOD#QUALITY
 i got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries . i would recommend roxy 's for that , but not for their food . my son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge ! but , they were too big for the bun . consequently , their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did'nt feel like finishing them . also they were $ 15 each ! i had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll . it was $ 14 not really bad for a pound of pastrami-but it did n't have much taste-i 've had better for less elsewhere !

 we had the lobster sandwich and it was fantastic . my husband said he could 've eaten several more , the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had . we had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful . i recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one . we waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right . we will be back .

 the food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back . immediately after we paid , the waiter took the money and said , okay , you guys are outta here . there are other people waiting ! we were n't even at our table for more than an hour total . as we were leaving , the couple standing by the door said to another waiter , we 're not in a hurry . our friends have not arrived yet . so rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary ! for the people who want great food plus great service , roxy is a place to avoid !

 the worst excuse for japanese food i 've ever encountered . the soup for the udon was soy sauce and water . the sushi was awful ! the rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard . furthermore , the rice had no seasoning , so the sushi was bland and disgusting . the fish was adequate , but inexpertly sliced . it is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with japanese cuisine .

 do not get the go go hamburgers , no matter what the reviews say . they were such a rip-off ( $ 8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns ) and not worth trying . the rest of the dim sum , though pricey by chinatown standards , is worth it . steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table . the wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek ( for chinatown ) alternative . a few tips : skip the turnip cake , roast pork buns and egg custards . these are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner : ( 1 ) turnip cakes at the little kiosk on east side of mott st. just south of bayard ( 2 ) egg custards and pork buns at either bakery on west side of mott street just south of canal .

 this place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service . the only thing you can do here is walk in and eat .. but planning an event , especially a small , intimate one , forget about it . they are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place , but also become hostile ! nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end , not one person takes responsibility for anything . terrible , terrible management - deserves to be shut-down .

 my friend from milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian . too bad the food was n't of the same heritage . the porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless , so was the seafood tagliatelle . a real dissapointment . but that was n't the icing on the cake : a tiramisu that resembled nothing i have ever had . they should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips-good but a far cry from what the name implies . priced at upper intermediate range .

FOOD#QUALITY
 the food was actually aweful . i 'm not picky - but it was actually gross . the mussles were the fishiest things i 've ever tasted , the seabass was bland , the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese , the penne w/ chicken had bones in it ... it was disgusting . nice atmosphere , the service was very pleasant and the desert was good . would n't recomend it for dinner !

 went here last night - nice decor , good service , but the food was surprisingly excellent . the portions are huge , so it might be good to order three things to split ( rather than one appetizer and entree per person ) for two people . among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants , this offers by far one of the best values for your money . ca n't wait to go back .

 this place ... we stumbled upon it on labor day weekend . whoever the jazz duo was , they were on point . good music , great food , speedy service affordable prices . even the wine by the glass was good . its a little out of the way if you do n't live in the neighborhood , but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are .

if you do n't mind pre-sliced low quality fish , unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place .
FOOD#QUALITY
 just moved to the neighborhood and we 've been trying all the west village sushi restaurants . if you do n't mind pre-sliced low quality fish , unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place . price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit . was n't going to share but i feel obligated ... while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing . no thanks ! ! !

 i just read mocaramel 's review and felt compelled to respond . i have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at la lanterna . over the years the host , vittorio , and his crew , have always treated me as family - although with all the business this not-so-little gem does , it amazing he 's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor . i 've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years : a new jazz bar , the most fantastic dining garden , the best thin crust pizzas , and now a lasagna menu which is to die for ( these are not your average lasagnas ) ! i love this place ! keep up the good work guys !

 this small astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in new york . small , bright , and clean , bz grill stands apart from the usual run of gyro joints , both in astoria and out . what really makes it shine is the food , which is aggressively seasoned with cyrpriot spices , and all made in-house ( even the gyro meat and sausages ) , and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected . all the various greek and cypriot dishes are excellent , but the gyro is the reason to come - if you do n't eat one your trip was wasted .

 this small astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in new york . small , bright , and clean , bz grill stands apart from the usual run of gyro joints , both in astoria and out . what really makes it shine is the food , which is aggressively seasoned with cyrpriot spices , and all made in-house ( even the gyro meat and sausages ) , and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected . all the various greek and cypriot dishes are excellent , but the gyro is the reason to come - if you do n't eat one your trip was wasted .

 short and sweet  seating is great : it 's romantic , cozy and private . the boths are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they 're perfect for 2 people . the service was extremely fast and attentive ( thanks to the service button on your table ) but i barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order . the food was ok and fair nothing to go crazy . over . over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals . so what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the food . will prob . not return but it is a great dinning experience to try atleast once .

 short and sweet  seating is great : it 's romantic , cozy and private . the boths are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they 're perfect for 2 people . the service was extremely fast and attentive ( thanks to the service button on your table ) but i barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order . the food was ok and fair nothing to go crazy . over . over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals . so what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the food . will prob . not return but it is a great dinning experience to try atleast once .

subtle food and service
FOOD#QUALITY
 impressed ... subtle food and service noodle pudding is exactly the type of service and food i enjoy . servers are all different , greg is my favorite . sometimes tables do n't understand his sense of humor but it 's refreshing to have a server who has personality , professionalism , and respects the privacy of your dinner . this is the first place i 've been that a runner remembers my order ... hope he likes his job because i have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant . prices are fair across the board for both food and bev . i go out to eat and like my courses , servers are patient and never rush courses or force another drink . restaurants in manhattan should try to model food and service after this place .

 maggot in the food ! i 've been wanting to go to this place forever and finally got a table . the menu looked great , and the waiter was very nice , but when the food came , it was average . nevertheless , i finished my plate , and that 's when i found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom . i showed it to the manager , and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts ( but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for ) . when the bill came , nothing was comped , so i told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine , but i did n't think i should have to pay for food with a maggot in it . yes , i ate the food , but i certainly would not have if i had seen the maggot before eating , and i was at this point fairly sick to my stomach . the manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine ( which cost less than the food ) , and made it seem like a big concession . we paid and left because we did n't feel like arguing any more . i have worked in restaurants and cook a lot , and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food . for a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed , there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service .

 amazing food . mazing interior . great food ! i 've had my fair share of modern japanese and this spot delivers . the atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking , which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors . if you 're into being lost when you 're just five feet from your table then hey , that 's a good thing . despite the confusing mirrors this will likely be my go-to for modern japanese food for the foreseeable future . another review here claimed the pre-fix was $ 29/per person including sake but it is $ 55 per person not including sake .

but $ 500 for a dinner for two that did n't include wine ?
FOOD#PRICES
 there is `` expensive-but-worth-it '' and there is `` expensive-and-wtf '' ? this is a twenty-something guy that does n't mind laying down $ 300 for a fine and delicious meal for 2 on special occassions . but $ 500 for a dinner for two that did n't include wine ? are you freaking kidding me ? look , the appetizers were really good . the entree was also very good . ca n't argue about that , but they are clearly over priced . what you are paying for is the environment and the name . yes , the place is classy and beautiful , but they most certainly target the uber whealthy not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while . $ 500 included : drinks : 2 glasses of dom perignon at $ 35 each . starters : kobe beef sashimi . which of course is not real kobe but wagyu beef . surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as kobe . a beef consomme . entrees : vanison steak and bison steak . vanison was good but not amazing . bison was quite excellent however . dessert : pure disaster . just not good at all . some pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing not impressive at all . i read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and i thought to myself , but may be it is worth it . i was wrong . the four seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of new york city restaurants , but trust me , they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say `` i 've been to the four seasons restaurant '' . i wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly , curiousity got the best of me and i paid dearly for it . all in all , the food was great ( except for the dessserts ) . the environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts . if you are going for the food , it will not be worth it . yes , it is good , but i 've had better for cheaper . you would think they would make up for it with service , sadly , no . service was just ok , it is not what you 'd expect for $ 500 .

 there is `` expensive-but-worth-it '' and there is `` expensive-and-wtf '' ? this is a twenty-something guy that does n't mind laying down $ 300 for a fine and delicious meal for 2 on special occassions . but $ 500 for a dinner for two that did n't include wine ? are you freaking kidding me ? look , the appetizers were really good . the entree was also very good . ca n't argue about that , but they are clearly over priced . what you are paying for is the environment and the name . yes , the place is classy and beautiful , but they most certainly target the uber whealthy not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while . $ 500 included : drinks : 2 glasses of dom perignon at $ 35 each . starters : kobe beef sashimi . which of course is not real kobe but wagyu beef . surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as kobe . a beef consomme . entrees : vanison steak and bison steak . vanison was good but not amazing . bison was quite excellent however . dessert : pure disaster . just not good at all . some pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing not impressive at all . i read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and i thought to myself , but may be it is worth it . i was wrong . the four seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of new york city restaurants , but trust me , they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say `` i 've been to the four seasons restaurant '' . i wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly , curiousity got the best of me and i paid dearly for it . all in all , the food was great ( except for the dessserts ) . the environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts . if you are going for the food , it will not be worth it . yes , it is good , but i 've had better for cheaper . you would think they would make up for it with service , sadly , no . service was just ok , it is not what you 'd expect for $ 500 .

 wretched and retching this will be only the third online review i have ever made about a restaurant in my life . they have all been tonight and they have all been about the same restaurant . i have never been so disgusted by both food an service . for starters they delivered us someone else 's order . fine , i wont hang you for that . however , once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it 's your only option ) , i got through about half my kimchee before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin . not one to jump to complaints ( hence my lack of previous online reviewing ) , i called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations . my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation . none was made so i hung up . less than three minutes passed before i found myself doubled over the toilet . my girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant . not only have i worked in restaurants for many years , i am now in culinary school , i am a huge lover of oysters and fish , and my girlfriend is half korean ! we know the difference between and oyster and bad fish . it was n't as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand , but now it 's simply repulsive . eat at your own risk .

my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .

 more williamsburg garbage my wife and i visited dokebi tonight . we ordered dosut bibimbap and nakgi-bokum . the dishes came out around 5 minutes apart . the bibimbap was average , but the stone bowl was n't even close to sizzling . too bad i had paid an extra $ 2 for the stone bowl . the nakgi-bokum was horrible . easily the worst stir-fried squid i 've ever tasted . the sauce tasted more like chinese fast food than decent korean . the side dishes were passable , and i did get a refill upon request . the real problem i had with this place was the complete lack of service . i mentioned the squid dish was n't very good when the waitress visited . she just nodded and walked off . there were no communications issues either , as she spoke perfect english . as to my comment about the food , no apology or acknowledgment was made . my wife had barely touched that mess of a dish . we were charged full price . if you ware looking for korean fusion , i suggest you try some of the places in the east village . authentic korean food lovers should visit 32nd street , of course .

possibly the most romantic restaurant in the city
AMBIENCE#GENERAL
 possibly the most romantic restaurant in the city this is undoubtedly my favorite modern japanese brasserie ( that don  t serve sushi ) , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city ! not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate dcor will make you feel like you  re no longer in the city . if you  re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you  ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching ( choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! ) . it  s just you and your date and an occasional cute  excuse me  before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth ! my party had the bbe $ 29 fixe prix menu , which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake ! i never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it . we started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche . our first course was tuna sashimi with green yuzu sauce . i picked the grilled black cod as my entree , which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better . the entrees were served with miso soup and rice . the sake  s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world . for desserts , we tried the frozen black sesame mousse ( interesting but not extraordinary ) and matcha ( powdered green tea ) and blueberry cheesecake , which was phenomenal . maybe it was the great company ( i had friends visiting from philly  yes , it was not a date this time ) or the super reasonable price point , but i just can  t say enough good things about this brasserie . i don  t usually visit the same establishment more than once , what more twice , but i  ll come to zenkichi anytime for a quiet , unhurried and memorable dinner .

 possibly the most romantic restaurant in the city this is undoubtedly my favorite modern japanese brasserie ( that don  t serve sushi ) , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city ! not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate dcor will make you feel like you  re no longer in the city . if you  re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you  ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching ( choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! ) . it  s just you and your date and an occasional cute  excuse me  before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth ! my party had the bbe $ 29 fixe prix menu , which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake ! i never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it . we started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche . our first course was tuna sashimi with green yuzu sauce . i picked the grilled black cod as my entree , which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better . the entrees were served with miso soup and rice . the sake  s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world . for desserts , we tried the frozen black sesame mousse ( interesting but not extraordinary ) and matcha ( powdered green tea ) and blueberry cheesecake , which was phenomenal . maybe it was the great company ( i had friends visiting from philly  yes , it was not a date this time ) or the super reasonable price point , but i just can  t say enough good things about this brasserie . i don  t usually visit the same establishment more than once , what more twice , but i  ll come to zenkichi anytime for a quiet , unhurried and memorable dinner .

 great shabu shabu i go here at least once every other week , particularly when it 's cold ! i love it . to be honest we only ever eat the shabu shabu . i tried a couple other dishes but was n't too impressed . but for the shabu shabu , you wo n't find much better in ny . in fact there is only one i 've tried that even compares ( shabu tatsu ) and even then i prefer dokebi . the meat is fresh , the sauces are great , you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too .

the servers at flatbush farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention .
SERVICE#GENERAL
 dumbfoundingly poor this was , from start to finish , a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience . lexicographers take note : a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in brooklyn . the servers at flatbush farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention . polite acknowledgement is out ; supercilious scorn is in . and how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins , inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent ? a different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) . overall the food quality was pretty good , though i hear the salmon is much better when it has n't sat cooling in front of the guest . the place has a nice fit-out , some attractive furnishings and , from what i could tell , a reasonable wine list ( i was given the food menu when i asked for the carte des vins ) at $ 120 for two people , however , this in no way represents value , unless you 're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture . on that scale , it 's a world-beater .

 dumbfoundingly poor this was , from start to finish , a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience . lexicographers take note : a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in brooklyn . the servers at flatbush farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention . polite acknowledgement is out ; supercilious scorn is in . and how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins , inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent ? a different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) . overall the food quality was pretty good , though i hear the salmon is much better when it has n't sat cooling in front of the guest . the place has a nice fit-out , some attractive furnishings and , from what i could tell , a reasonable wine list ( i was given the food menu when i asked for the carte des vins ) at $ 120 for two people , however , this in no way represents value , unless you 're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture . on that scale , it 's a world-beater .

 how is this palce still open ? i honestly do n't even know where to begin . my boyfriend and i are avid restaurant goers , and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended flatbush farms . we arrived and were seated immediately , which made us both happy . we ordered our appetizers , i ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon . everything was going good until we got our meals . i took one look at the chicken and i was appalled . it was served with skin , over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes . my boyfriend asked me if i wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead , while he de-skinned the chicken so that i could enjoy the white meat . i took one bite from the $ 24 salmon , and i have never , in the 17 years i have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in flatbush farms . at this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and did n't say anything , and guess what , the waitress walked away . so , i switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that i just could not bite through it . i could n't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach . i 've had better chicken at bbqs ! ! ! ! so i decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible . guess what , i waited for twenty minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , `` oh well , i wish you would have said something earlier '' no apology , nothing . after that she simply took our plates , walked away , came back another twenty minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! no desert menu , no apology , nothing ! ! ! ! ! ! i was literally going to explode , but instead , my boyfriend took the bill and went to find the manager . this is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she did n't like it , and i can not comp it . again , no apology , no is there anything else i can get you , no can i get you a drink to make up for it , nothing ! ! ! ! we refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore . the level of rudeness was preposterous . the manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out . i have never ever had such an unpleasant experience . this staff should be fired .

 fabulous food - if the front of house staff do n't put you off  we live nearby bfc . it 's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions , but we 've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years . each time we 've been , the front of house staff ( not the waiters - they 're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes i would never return . as bfc does n't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later ! the frizzy retro girl ( with winged/ dame edna glasses ) will yell at you if you try to order a drink . i was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a friday night because she `` had a bbq to go to '' that night - wtf ? ? i 'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely ! there 's another girl who i ca n't describe , she is about 5'6 '' with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're *really* talking about . i 'm a friendly person , so i would n't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal . again , i 'd be super upset if that were my employee . considering you will spend at least $ 60 a head , i expect better service . so , if you 're walking by and thinking about dining , you might want to see who 's going to be seating you first ...

SERVICE#GENERAL
 maitre-d- '' eat and get out '' my family ate here last weekend . the food and service were fine , however the maitre-d was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant . while finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine , our son 's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert . this guy refused to seat her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before i told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including paris , that i had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant . his response was smug , arrogant , and condescending , totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening . a word to the wise : you ca n't dine here and disturb the maitre-d 's sense of `` table turnover '' , as whacked as it is , or else . if you go here , do it on his off-night .

 what a hassle ! the food is very good , but not outstanding . there is no way it justifies the accolades it receives , the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table . on our last visit , they skipped over our name on the list , leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table . mistakes happen , but they are usually accompanied by an apology , perhaps even a glass of wine ... but not the grunt that we received from the al di la staff . without the wait or attitude , i would probably go back , but there are just too many other restaurants in brooklyn that are as good or better and do n't make me jump through hoops .

 bad staff i generally like this place . the food is good . the design of the space is good . but the service is horrid ! i was there for brunch recently , and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter . the waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand . i ca n't believe that it was , but please put the bag down before delivering food ! the waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating ( a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so i try to ignore it ) . i could n't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends , who was in mid bite , to clear the table . she then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables . i wish i could like this place more , and i wish someone would retrain the staff .
