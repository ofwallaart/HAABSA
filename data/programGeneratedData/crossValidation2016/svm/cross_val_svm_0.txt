 i had my eyes on this place , promising myself i will one day 'give it a try . ' and i hate to say this but i doubt i 'll ever go back . the food is very average ... the thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet , every thing they serve is too sweet here . the only thing i moderately enjoyed was their grilled chicken special with edamame puree . i had never had edamame pureed before but i thought it was innovative and tasty ( could 've used a bit more salt ) . anyways , if you 're in the neighborhood to eat good food , i would n't waste my time trying to find something , rather go across the street to tamari . the decor is night tho ... but they really need to clean that vent in the ceiling ... its quite un-appetizing , and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern .

FOOD#QUALITY
 i tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin , which was heavenly at sushi rose . it melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy , creamy , and slightly buttery . the sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned . the rice to fish ration was also good - they did n't try to overpack the rice . we took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it .

 i live a block away and go to patsy 's frequently . the pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap , frozen , shredded cheese common to most pizzaria 's . two complaints- their appetizer selection stinks , it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu . also , because it is so thin , it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling . so eat fast and order a lot . wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the uws !

 i stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two fridays ago when i was with two friends in town from l.a . being serious sushi lovers , we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action . i asked the chef what he recommends and he asked me if i like uni . ( for those of you who do n't know , uni is sea urchin in japanese , which happens to be my favorite . ) he served me an uni hand roll , which i never had before , and let me tell you ... it was heaven ! aside from the sea urchin , the chef recommended an assortment of fish including fatty yellow tail , boton shrimp , blue fin torro ( fatty tuna ) , sea eel , etc . the sake menu should not be overlooked ! all in all , this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city . try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll .

 this is some really good , inexpensive sushi . it costs $ 2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll , but the roll more than triples in size , and that 's not just from the rice . the spicy tuna roll is huge and probably the best that i 've had at this price range . the yellowtail was particularly good as well . i have reservations about the all you can eat deal , however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu . in any event , this is a place i 'll be sure to stop by again when i 'm in this part of town .

 went to village last night for my birthday . we picked it randomly , without a recommendation from someone who has been there , so we were n't sure what to expect . we were very pleasantly surprised . the food was delicious ( i had a halibut special , my husband had steak ) , and the service was top-notch . when my dessert came , there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift , and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort . truly the mark of an attentive waiter . i highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night .

SERVICE#GENERAL
 i like cafe noir dont get me wrong , it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent ! ! the service was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served . the waitress , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing . after dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend , asked him : where are you from ... maybe you dont know how things work in america ... and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on . we did tip , i guess the model / waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager . the whole set up is truly unprofessional and i wish cafe noir would get some good staff , because despite the current one this is a great place .

SERVICE#GENERAL
 i was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever . a gentleman , maybe the manager , came to our table , and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order . when asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants , he replied this is not mcdonald 's , every place makes things differently while it is understandable that every place is indeed different , there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude . the service was poor , restaurant poorly lit , staff not very attentive and i would have rather eaten at a mcdonald 's than this joint . never again !

 i got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries . i would recommend roxy 's for that , but not for their food . my son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge ! but , they were too big for the bun . consequently , their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did'nt feel like finishing them . also they were $ 15 each ! i had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll . it was $ 14 not really bad for a pound of pastrami-but it did n't have much taste-i 've had better for less elsewhere !

a few tips : skip the turnip cake , roast pork buns and egg custards .
FOOD#QUALITY
 do not get the go go hamburgers , no matter what the reviews say . they were such a rip-off ( $ 8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns ) and not worth trying . the rest of the dim sum , though pricey by chinatown standards , is worth it . steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table . the wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek ( for chinatown ) alternative . a few tips : skip the turnip cake , roast pork buns and egg custards . these are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner : ( 1 ) turnip cakes at the little kiosk on east side of mott st. just south of bayard ( 2 ) egg custards and pork buns at either bakery on west side of mott street just south of canal .

 excellent food for great prices my husband and i have been sold on this from the first visit . the wait staff is very courteous and accomodating . the space is limited so be prepared to wait up to 45 minutes - 1 hour , but be richly rewarded when you savor the delicious indo-chinese food . there are no negatives to speak of .

oh , and i never write reviews - i just was so moved by how bad this place was , i felt it was my duty to spread the word .
RESTAURANT#GENERAL
 gross food  wow- i ca n't remember the last time i had such gross food in new york . my quesadilla tasted like it had been made by a three-year old with no sense of proportion or flavor . and $ 11 for a plate of bland guacamole ? come on . do n't get me started on the margaritas , either . mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila . really , i find it rather scandalous that such a crappy restaurant attracts such crowds - this , in the city of a million restaurants , at least 9/10 of which are way better than this one . save your money and your time and go somewhere else . oh , and i never write reviews - i just was so moved by how bad this place was , i felt it was my duty to spread the word .

 raymond the bartender rocks ! pacifico is a great place to casually hang out . the drinks are great , especially when made by raymond . the omlette for brunch is great ... the spinach is fresh , definately not frozen ... quacamole at pacifico is yummy , as are the wings with chimmichuri . a weakness is the chicken in the salads . it 's just average , just shredded , no seasoning on it . also , i personally was n't a fan of the portobello and asparagus mole . overall , decent food at a good price , with friendly people .

when we inquired about ports - the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost .
SERVICE#GENERAL
 good experience during our trip to nyc , we made reservations to dine in the pool room of the four seasons for their pre-theater menu ( offering a modified menu for $ 65 pp ) . the wine list was extensive - though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings . the bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the `` free '' appetizer of olives was disappointing . however , our main course was wonderful . i had fish and my husband had the filet - both of which exceeded our expectations . the dessert ( we had a pear torte ) was good - but , once again , the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions . when we inquired about ports - the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost . not what i would expect for the price and prestige of this location . all in all , i would return - as it was a beautiful restaurant - but i hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future .

i read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and i thought to myself , but may be it is worth it .
RESTAURANT#GENERAL
 there is `` expensive-but-worth-it '' and there is `` expensive-and-wtf '' ? this is a twenty-something guy that does n't mind laying down $ 300 for a fine and delicious meal for 2 on special occassions . but $ 500 for a dinner for two that did n't include wine ? are you freaking kidding me ? look , the appetizers were really good . the entree was also very good . ca n't argue about that , but they are clearly over priced . what you are paying for is the environment and the name . yes , the place is classy and beautiful , but they most certainly target the uber whealthy not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while . $ 500 included : drinks : 2 glasses of dom perignon at $ 35 each . starters : kobe beef sashimi . which of course is not real kobe but wagyu beef . surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as kobe . a beef consomme . entrees : vanison steak and bison steak . vanison was good but not amazing . bison was quite excellent however . dessert : pure disaster . just not good at all . some pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing not impressive at all . i read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and i thought to myself , but may be it is worth it . i was wrong . the four seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of new york city restaurants , but trust me , they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say `` i 've been to the four seasons restaurant '' . i wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly , curiousity got the best of me and i paid dearly for it . all in all , the food was great ( except for the dessserts ) . the environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts . if you are going for the food , it will not be worth it . yes , it is good , but i 've had better for cheaper . you would think they would make up for it with service , sadly , no . service was just ok , it is not what you 'd expect for $ 500 .

FOOD#QUALITY
 terrible waste of money.. scammers i agree that dining at casa la femme is like no other dining experience ! but not in a good way . i am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience . i literally just got back home after visiting casa la femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time . we went to celebrate two birthdays and wanted to do something special and different . our visit their to say the least , was an unpleasant and costly experience ! and even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience . we did arrive late for our reservation so i can not complain too much about the wait for a table . although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes . we were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited . the place is beautiful ! the hostess was very pleasant . however , our $ 14 drinks were were horrible ! once we finally got a table , despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed ! since we were already waiting so long , we felt we had no other choice but to accept it . our experience did not ever get any better . for each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink . we also asked for hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hooka . after the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner . we asked for beverages and never received them . we asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order . my chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin . i would not expect this for a $ 55 dinner . by the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage nor hooka ! what we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka.. some of which we never received ! the only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses ! to top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant . by the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs and we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers ! if it seemed possible to do so while there i would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible ! i have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused , and wasted my hard earned money . my husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended ... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly ! i wish i could be refunded !

FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS
 do n't go with a larger group than 4 ! i went here for a family birthday dinner . five of us walked in at approximately 6:20 on a thursday evening . the hostess said `` wow that 's a large group , unless you are n't together '' , to which i replied `` no we are , and there will be one more , so a table for six please . '' at first we were a little taken aback , as this seemed to present a problem , although the restaurant looked fairly empty , but they hastily put the table together for us . the menu is fairly simple without much descriptions . there was no tap beer that evening , which was a disappointment . not much of a selection of bottled beer either , we went with brahma . the appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion ( maybe 3 of each ) . the lobster knuckles ( special of the day ) were ok , but pretty tasteless . i believe there were 2 shrimp in the `` salt encrusted shrimp '' appetizer . after we ate our appetizers ( which took all of 8 minutes ) we ordered another round of brahma 's - and tried to stall a little as we waited for our sixth dinner member . the waitress appeared and asked us if we wanted to go ahead and order . we replied that we would like to wait 5 more minutes if that was okay . she replied `` well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now , since you are a larger party , and it might get crowded . '' we called the other person who was very close by , and she told us to order for her , so we did . the food arrived in about 15 minutes . i had the thai style fried sea bass ... which was very good . everyone seemed generally happy with their food , except my brother who had the grilled mahi mahi , seemingly drenched in grapfruit juice ! i heard the lobster roll was excellent . they seemed to continue to rush us along , taking plates without asking if we were done ( my sister still had her fork in hand ) . all in all the food was good - a little on the expensive side , but fresh . service not the friendliest to our `` large party '' ! probably would not go back here .

 great indian food i lived on 50th st , and wanted indian one day so decided to check this place out . food was amazing - i love indian food and eat it quite regularly , but i can say this is one of the best i 've had . very `` normal indian food '' , but done really well . i have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price ( just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $ 25 ) , which i would expect at a upscale indian restaurant but this place does n't have an upscale feel . also , waiters try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ . i do n't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron 's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff ( more than the price ) . but if you 're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary , then this is the place to go for indian food

 wretched and retching this will be only the third online review i have ever made about a restaurant in my life . they have all been tonight and they have all been about the same restaurant . i have never been so disgusted by both food an service . for starters they delivered us someone else 's order . fine , i wont hang you for that . however , once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it 's your only option ) , i got through about half my kimchee before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin . not one to jump to complaints ( hence my lack of previous online reviewing ) , i called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations . my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation . none was made so i hung up . less than three minutes passed before i found myself doubled over the toilet . my girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant . not only have i worked in restaurants for many years , i am now in culinary school , i am a huge lover of oysters and fish , and my girlfriend is half korean ! we know the difference between and oyster and bad fish . it was n't as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand , but now it 's simply repulsive . eat at your own risk .

 more williamsburg garbage my wife and i visited dokebi tonight . we ordered dosut bibimbap and nakgi-bokum . the dishes came out around 5 minutes apart . the bibimbap was average , but the stone bowl was n't even close to sizzling . too bad i had paid an extra $ 2 for the stone bowl . the nakgi-bokum was horrible . easily the worst stir-fried squid i 've ever tasted . the sauce tasted more like chinese fast food than decent korean . the side dishes were passable , and i did get a refill upon request . the real problem i had with this place was the complete lack of service . i mentioned the squid dish was n't very good when the waitress visited . she just nodded and walked off . there were no communications issues either , as she spoke perfect english . as to my comment about the food , no apology or acknowledgment was made . my wife had barely touched that mess of a dish . we were charged full price . if you ware looking for korean fusion , i suggest you try some of the places in the east village . authentic korean food lovers should visit 32nd street , of course .

RESTAURANT#GENERAL
 possibly the most romantic restaurant in the city this is undoubtedly my favorite modern japanese brasserie ( that don  t serve sushi ) , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city ! not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate dcor will make you feel like you  re no longer in the city . if you  re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you  ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching ( choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! ) . it  s just you and your date and an occasional cute  excuse me  before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth ! my party had the bbe $ 29 fixe prix menu , which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake ! i never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it . we started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche . our first course was tuna sashimi with green yuzu sauce . i picked the grilled black cod as my entree , which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better . the entrees were served with miso soup and rice . the sake  s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world . for desserts , we tried the frozen black sesame mousse ( interesting but not extraordinary ) and matcha ( powdered green tea ) and blueberry cheesecake , which was phenomenal . maybe it was the great company ( i had friends visiting from philly  yes , it was not a date this time ) or the super reasonable price point , but i just can  t say enough good things about this brasserie . i don  t usually visit the same establishment more than once , what more twice , but i  ll come to zenkichi anytime for a quiet , unhurried and memorable dinner .

 possibly the most romantic restaurant in the city this is undoubtedly my favorite modern japanese brasserie ( that don  t serve sushi ) , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city ! not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate dcor will make you feel like you  re no longer in the city . if you  re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you  ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching ( choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! ) . it  s just you and your date and an occasional cute  excuse me  before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth ! my party had the bbe $ 29 fixe prix menu , which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake ! i never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it . we started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche . our first course was tuna sashimi with green yuzu sauce . i picked the grilled black cod as my entree , which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better . the entrees were served with miso soup and rice . the sake  s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world . for desserts , we tried the frozen black sesame mousse ( interesting but not extraordinary ) and matcha ( powdered green tea ) and blueberry cheesecake , which was phenomenal . maybe it was the great company ( i had friends visiting from philly  yes , it was not a date this time ) or the super reasonable price point , but i just can  t say enough good things about this brasserie . i don  t usually visit the same establishment more than once , what more twice , but i  ll come to zenkichi anytime for a quiet , unhurried and memorable dinner .

 great shabu shabu i go here at least once every other week , particularly when it 's cold ! i love it . to be honest we only ever eat the shabu shabu . i tried a couple other dishes but was n't too impressed . but for the shabu shabu , you wo n't find much better in ny . in fact there is only one i 've tried that even compares ( shabu tatsu ) and even then i prefer dokebi . the meat is fresh , the sauces are great , you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too .

the place has a nice fit-out , some attractive furnishings and , from what i could tell , a reasonable wine list ( i was given the food menu when i asked for the carte des vins )
DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS
 dumbfoundingly poor this was , from start to finish , a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience . lexicographers take note : a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in brooklyn . the servers at flatbush farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention . polite acknowledgement is out ; supercilious scorn is in . and how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins , inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent ? a different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) . overall the food quality was pretty good , though i hear the salmon is much better when it has n't sat cooling in front of the guest . the place has a nice fit-out , some attractive furnishings and , from what i could tell , a reasonable wine list ( i was given the food menu when i asked for the carte des vins ) at $ 120 for two people , however , this in no way represents value , unless you 're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture . on that scale , it 's a world-beater .

 great hot dogs ! i 've made the trip out here a few times with a friend who lives nearby ( i live on uws ) . though it 's been crowded most times i 've gone here , bark always delivers on their food . the hot dogs are top notch , and they 're slamwich is amazing ! going to bark is always worth the train ride , and will make your tongue and belly very happy ! only complaint is the pricing - i believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu . but nonetheless - great spot , great food .

fabulous food - if the front of house staff do n't put you off 
SERVICE#GENERAL
 fabulous food - if the front of house staff do n't put you off  we live nearby bfc . it 's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions , but we 've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years . each time we 've been , the front of house staff ( not the waiters - they 're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes i would never return . as bfc does n't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later ! the frizzy retro girl ( with winged/ dame edna glasses ) will yell at you if you try to order a drink . i was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a friday night because she `` had a bbq to go to '' that night - wtf ? ? i 'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely ! there 's another girl who i ca n't describe , she is about 5'6 '' with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're *really* talking about . i 'm a friendly person , so i would n't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal . again , i 'd be super upset if that were my employee . considering you will spend at least $ 60 a head , i expect better service . so , if you 're walking by and thinking about dining , you might want to see who 's going to be seating you first ...

FOOD#QUALITY
 maitre-d- '' eat and get out '' my family ate here last weekend . the food and service were fine , however the maitre-d was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant . while finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine , our son 's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert . this guy refused to seat her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before i told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including paris , that i had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant . his response was smug , arrogant , and condescending , totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening . a word to the wise : you ca n't dine here and disturb the maitre-d 's sense of `` table turnover '' , as whacked as it is , or else . if you go here , do it on his off-night .

 taking hot dogs to the next level at first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint , but at bark you do n't just get your average hot dog . here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available .

don  t go to this place !
RESTAURANT#GENERAL
 poor service and management don  t go to this place ! had an awful experience at casa la femme on a saturday dinner . appetizers took nearly an hour . when the main course finally arrived ( another 45mins ) half of our order was missing . never got an explanation as to what was going on . the manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly . when we threatened to leave , we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing . on the way out , we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues . can  t believe how an expensive nyc restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients .

SERVICE#GENERAL
 so rude ! ! ! i went with jwils . her review is above . i was one of the people that went for this horrible experience . my friend is 100 % right in the experience we had . the hostess was rude and i got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us . the only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared . i asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like i was insane . i was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said , `` can i help you '' and `` how many are in your party . '' what ? the three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were . we did n't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately i think that may have been part of the problem . shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent customer service .

SERVICE#GENERAL
 bad staff i generally like this place . the food is good . the design of the space is good . but the service is horrid ! i was there for brunch recently , and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter . the waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand . i ca n't believe that it was , but please put the bag down before delivering food ! the waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating ( a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so i try to ignore it ) . i could n't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends , who was in mid bite , to clear the table . she then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables . i wish i could like this place more , and i wish someone would retrain the staff .
