subtle food and service
SERVICE#GENERAL
 impressed ... subtle food and service noodle pudding is exactly the type of service and food i enjoy . servers are all different , greg is my favorite . sometimes tables do n't understand his sense of humor but it 's refreshing to have a server who has personality , professionalism , and respects the privacy of your dinner . this is the first place i 've been that a runner remembers my order ... hope he likes his job because i have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant . prices are fair across the board for both food and bev . i go out to eat and like my courses , servers are patient and never rush courses or force another drink . restaurants in manhattan should try to model food and service after this place .

just go to yamato and order the red dragon roll .
RESTAURANT#GENERAL
 red dragon roll - my favorite thing to eat , of any food group - hands down just go to yamato and order the red dragon roll . if you do n't like it , i do n't know what to tell you . the seafood dynamite is also otherworldly . i 'm not even going to bother to describe it ; it speaks for itself .

this place has totally weird decor , stairs going up with mirrored walls - i am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional ...
AMBIENCE#GENERAL
 this place does n't make any sense just want to warn you all - do n't waste your time and money . this place has totally weird decor , stairs going up with mirrored walls - i am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional ... this place is not inviting and the food is totally weird . the concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly does n't work . the food they serve is not comforting , not appetizing and uncooked . go to japanese sushi place or spanish tapas place - this creation in williamsburg is a misstake .

FOOD#QUALITY
 i got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries . i would recommend roxy 's for that , but not for their food . my son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge ! but , they were too big for the bun . consequently , their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did'nt feel like finishing them . also they were $ 15 each ! i had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll . it was $ 14 not really bad for a pound of pastrami-but it did n't have much taste-i 've had better for less elsewhere !

 mermaid inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood . the menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent . the lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with scallops and shrimp is great . the service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing . the only fallback on this restaurant is the prices . even though its good seafood , the prices are too high . the lobster sandwich is $ 24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price .

we did arrive late for our reservation so i can not complain too much about the wait for a table .
SERVICE#GENERAL
 terrible waste of money.. scammers i agree that dining at casa la femme is like no other dining experience ! but not in a good way . i am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience . i literally just got back home after visiting casa la femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time . we went to celebrate two birthdays and wanted to do something special and different . our visit their to say the least , was an unpleasant and costly experience ! and even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience . we did arrive late for our reservation so i can not complain too much about the wait for a table . although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes . we were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited . the place is beautiful ! the hostess was very pleasant . however , our $ 14 drinks were were horrible ! once we finally got a table , despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed ! since we were already waiting so long , we felt we had no other choice but to accept it . our experience did not ever get any better . for each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink . we also asked for hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hooka . after the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner . we asked for beverages and never received them . we asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order . my chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin . i would not expect this for a $ 55 dinner . by the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage nor hooka ! what we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka.. some of which we never received ! the only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses ! to top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant . by the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs and we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers ! if it seemed possible to do so while there i would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible ! i have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused , and wasted my hard earned money . my husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended ... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly ! i wish i could be refunded !

the frizzy retro girl ( with winged/ dame edna glasses ) will yell at you if you try to order a drink .
SERVICE#GENERAL
 fabulous food - if the front of house staff do n't put you off – we live nearby bfc . it 's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions , but we 've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years . each time we 've been , the front of house staff ( not the waiters - they 're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes i would never return . as bfc does n't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later ! the frizzy retro girl ( with winged/ dame edna glasses ) will yell at you if you try to order a drink . i was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a friday night because she `` had a bbq to go to '' that night - wtf ? ? i 'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely ! there 's another girl who i ca n't describe , she is about 5'6 '' with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're *really* talking about . i 'm a friendly person , so i would n't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal . again , i 'd be super upset if that were my employee . considering you will spend at least $ 60 a head , i expect better service . so , if you 're walking by and thinking about dining , you might want to see who 's going to be seating you first ...

FOOD#QUALITY
 do not get the go go hamburgers , no matter what the reviews say . they were such a rip-off ( $ 8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns ) and not worth trying . the rest of the dim sum , though pricey by chinatown standards , is worth it . steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table . the wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek ( for chinatown ) alternative . a few tips : skip the turnip cake , roast pork buns and egg custards . these are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner : ( 1 ) turnip cakes at the little kiosk on east side of mott st. just south of bayard ( 2 ) egg custards and pork buns at either bakery on west side of mott street just south of canal .

 i like cafe noir dont get me wrong , it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent ! ! the service was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served . the waitress , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing . after dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend , asked him : where are you from ... maybe you dont know how things work in america ... and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on . we did tip , i guess the model / waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager . the whole set up is truly unprofessional and i wish cafe noir would get some good staff , because despite the current one this is a great place .

 went to cafe spice with 4 of my friends on a saturday night . we were greeted promptly by the waiter who was very nice and cordial . she was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering a lot of good dishes since we knew nothing about indian food . we were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry . the food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates . we ended our great experience by having gulab jamun ( dessert ) recommended by the waiter . i thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others .

the waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating ( a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so i try to ignore it ) .
SERVICE#GENERAL
 bad staff i generally like this place . the food is good . the design of the space is good . but the service is horrid ! i was there for brunch recently , and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter . the waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand . i ca n't believe that it was , but please put the bag down before delivering food ! the waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating ( a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so i try to ignore it ) . i could n't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends , who was in mid bite , to clear the table . she then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables . i wish i could like this place more , and i wish someone would retrain the staff .

the decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall , which are great for a date .
AMBIENCE#GENERAL
 i 've been to at cafe spice probably 5-8 times , it is probably still the best indian restaurant around union square . to sum it up : service varies from good to mediorce , depending on which waiter you get ; generally it is just average ok . seating is always prompt , though the restaurant does fill up in the evening . food is usually very good , though ocasionally i wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders . as many other reviewers noticed , your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time . the decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall , which are great for a date .

 the food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back . immediately after we paid , the waiter took the money and said , okay , you guys are outta here . there are other people waiting ! we were n't even at our table for more than an hour total . as we were leaving , the couple standing by the door said to another waiter , we 're not in a hurry . our friends have not arrived yet . so rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary ! for the people who want great food plus great service , roxy is a place to avoid !

 i had my eyes on this place , promising myself i will one day 'give it a try .

 love the scene first off- the place has a character and nice light to it..very fortunate , location wise . the pizza was pretty good and huge . the price very reasonable . we were 4 and got the family size penne a la vodka which was tremendously gigantic portion ... a bucket of food literally . we got most of it back at home with us . i would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i ca n't not mention or undermine . the pasta penne was pretty extra buttery , creamy which means a big task to diggest.. tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count , penne ... got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed ... lol

 maggot in the food ! i 've been wanting to go to this place forever and finally got a table . the menu looked great , and the waiter was very nice , but when the food came , it was average . nevertheless , i finished my plate , and that 's when i found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom . i showed it to the manager , and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts ( but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for ) . when the bill came , nothing was comped , so i told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine , but i did n't think i should have to pay for food with a maggot in it . yes , i ate the food , but i certainly would not have if i had seen the maggot before eating , and i was at this point fairly sick to my stomach . the manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine ( which cost less than the food ) , and made it seem like a big concession . we paid and left because we did n't feel like arguing any more . i have worked in restaurants and cook a lot , and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food . for a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed , there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service .

 raymond the bartender rocks ! pacifico is a great place to casually hang out . the drinks are great , especially when made by raymond . the omlette for brunch is great ... the spinach is fresh , definately not frozen ... quacamole at pacifico is yummy , as are the wings with chimmichuri . a weakness is the chicken in the salads . it 's just average , just shredded , no seasoning on it . also , i personally was n't a fan of the portobello and asparagus mole . overall , decent food at a good price , with friendly people .

RESTAURANT#GENERAL
 the place is a bistro which means : simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere . and where does patis go wrong ; no where . you are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but : cassuolet , steake fritte , tripe stew , etc ; simple stuff . and evaluated on those terms pastis is simply wonderful .

 went to ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza ( as i love la pizza fresca ) . was surprisingly disappointed . pizza was a little soggy . ravioli was good ... but i have to say that i found everything a bit overpriced . not enough wines by the glass either . service , however , was excellent ... and i liked the setting/atmosphere a lot . food was just average ... if they lowered the prices just a bit , it would be a bigger draw .

 right off the l in brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza . mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta ( raddichio was kind of bitter though ) . my friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better . the sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day . kind of a small place but i guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids . overall i would recommend it and go back again . coming from boston this place is like emma 's pizza in kendall square in cambridge ( although they have more funky toppings ! )

for a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed , there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service .
SERVICE#GENERAL
 maggot in the food ! i 've been wanting to go to this place forever and finally got a table . the menu looked great , and the waiter was very nice , but when the food came , it was average . nevertheless , i finished my plate , and that 's when i found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom . i showed it to the manager , and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts ( but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for ) . when the bill came , nothing was comped , so i told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine , but i did n't think i should have to pay for food with a maggot in it . yes , i ate the food , but i certainly would not have if i had seen the maggot before eating , and i was at this point fairly sick to my stomach . the manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine ( which cost less than the food ) , and made it seem like a big concession . we paid and left because we did n't feel like arguing any more . i have worked in restaurants and cook a lot , and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food . for a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed , there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service .

RESTAURANT#PRICES
 great indian food i lived on 50th st , and wanted indian one day so decided to check this place out . food was amazing - i love indian food and eat it quite regularly , but i can say this is one of the best i 've had . very `` normal indian food '' , but done really well . i have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price ( just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $ 25 ) , which i would expect at a upscale indian restaurant but this place does n't have an upscale feel . also , waiters try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ . i do n't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron 's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff ( more than the price ) . but if you 're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary , then this is the place to go for indian food

FOOD#QUALITY
 good experience during our trip to nyc , we made reservations to dine in the pool room of the four seasons for their pre-theater menu ( offering a modified menu for $ 65 pp ) . the wine list was extensive - though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings . the bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the `` free '' appetizer of olives was disappointing . however , our main course was wonderful . i had fish and my husband had the filet - both of which exceeded our expectations . the dessert ( we had a pear torte ) was good - but , once again , the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions . when we inquired about ports - the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost . not what i would expect for the price and prestige of this location . all in all , i would return - as it was a beautiful restaurant - but i hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future .

i don ’ t usually visit the same establishment more than once , what more twice , but i ’ ll come to zenkichi anytime for a quiet , unhurried and memorable dinner .
RESTAURANT#GENERAL
 possibly the most romantic restaurant in the city this is undoubtedly my favorite modern japanese brasserie ( that don ’ t serve sushi ) , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city ! not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you ’ re no longer in the city . if you ’ re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you ’ ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching ( choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! ) . it ’ s just you and your date and an occasional cute ‘ excuse me ’ before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth ! my party had the bbe $ 29 fixe prix menu , which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake ! i never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it . we started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche . our first course was tuna sashimi with green yuzu sauce . i picked the grilled black cod as my entree , which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better . the entrees were served with miso soup and rice . the sake ’ s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world . for desserts , we tried the frozen black sesame mousse ( interesting but not extraordinary ) and matcha ( powdered green tea ) and blueberry cheesecake , which was phenomenal . maybe it was the great company ( i had friends visiting from philly – yes , it was not a date this time ) or the super reasonable price point , but i just can ’ t say enough good things about this brasserie . i don ’ t usually visit the same establishment more than once , what more twice , but i ’ ll come to zenkichi anytime for a quiet , unhurried and memorable dinner .

FOOD#QUALITY
 wretched and retching this will be only the third online review i have ever made about a restaurant in my life . they have all been tonight and they have all been about the same restaurant . i have never been so disgusted by both food an service . for starters they delivered us someone else 's order . fine , i wont hang you for that . however , once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it 's your only option ) , i got through about half my kimchee before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin . not one to jump to complaints ( hence my lack of previous online reviewing ) , i called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations . my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation . none was made so i hung up . less than three minutes passed before i found myself doubled over the toilet . my girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant . not only have i worked in restaurants for many years , i am now in culinary school , i am a huge lover of oysters and fish , and my girlfriend is half korean ! we know the difference between and oyster and bad fish . it was n't as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand , but now it 's simply repulsive . eat at your own risk .

 i was very disappointed with this restaurant . ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away . i had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish ive requested . food was okay , nothing great . chow fun was dry ; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family . i/we will never go back to this place again .

 favorite sushi in nyc i have eaten at some of the 'best ' sushi joints in nyc ( nobu , bond street , jewelbako , etc ) and yamato is my favorite . an unpretentious spot in park slope , the sushi is consistently good , the service is pleasant , effective and unassuming . in the summer months , the back garden area is really nice . the rolls are creative and i have yet to find another sushi place that serves up more inventive yet delicious japanese food . the dancing , white river and millenium rolls are musts .

 i came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend . the decor is very simple but comfortable . the food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach . the portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that . you must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert . the staff there is very attentive and down to earth . i loved it and would go again .

however , our $ 14 drinks were were horrible !
DRINKS#QUALITY
 terrible waste of money.. scammers i agree that dining at casa la femme is like no other dining experience ! but not in a good way . i am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience . i literally just got back home after visiting casa la femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time . we went to celebrate two birthdays and wanted to do something special and different . our visit their to say the least , was an unpleasant and costly experience ! and even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience . we did arrive late for our reservation so i can not complain too much about the wait for a table . although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes . we were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited . the place is beautiful ! the hostess was very pleasant . however , our $ 14 drinks were were horrible ! once we finally got a table , despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed ! since we were already waiting so long , we felt we had no other choice but to accept it . our experience did not ever get any better . for each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink . we also asked for hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hooka . after the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner . we asked for beverages and never received them . we asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order . my chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin . i would not expect this for a $ 55 dinner . by the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage nor hooka ! what we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka.. some of which we never received ! the only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses ! to top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant . by the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs and we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers ! if it seemed possible to do so while there i would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible ! i have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused , and wasted my hard earned money . my husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended ... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly ! i wish i could be refunded !

gross food – wow-
FOOD#QUALITY
 gross food – wow- i ca n't remember the last time i had such gross food in new york . my quesadilla tasted like it had been made by a three-year old with no sense of proportion or flavor . and $ 11 for a plate of bland guacamole ? come on . do n't get me started on the margaritas , either . mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila . really , i find it rather scandalous that such a crappy restaurant attracts such crowds - this , in the city of a million restaurants , at least 9/10 of which are way better than this one . save your money and your time and go somewhere else . oh , and i never write reviews - i just was so moved by how bad this place was , i felt it was my duty to spread the word .

the four seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of new york city restaurants , but trust me , they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say `` i 've been to the four seasons restaurant '' .
RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS
 there is `` expensive-but-worth-it '' and there is `` expensive-and-wtf '' ? this is a twenty-something guy that does n't mind laying down $ 300 for a fine and delicious meal for 2 on special occassions . but $ 500 for a dinner for two that did n't include wine ? are you freaking kidding me ? look , the appetizers were really good . the entree was also very good . ca n't argue about that , but they are clearly over priced . what you are paying for is the environment and the name . yes , the place is classy and beautiful , but they most certainly target the uber whealthy not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while . $ 500 included : drinks : 2 glasses of dom perignon at $ 35 each . starters : kobe beef sashimi . which of course is not real kobe but wagyu beef . surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as kobe . a beef consomme . entrees : vanison steak and bison steak . vanison was good but not amazing . bison was quite excellent however . dessert : pure disaster . just not good at all . some pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing not impressive at all . i read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and i thought to myself , but may be it is worth it . i was wrong . the four seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of new york city restaurants , but trust me , they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say `` i 've been to the four seasons restaurant '' . i wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly , curiousity got the best of me and i paid dearly for it . all in all , the food was great ( except for the dessserts ) . the environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts . if you are going for the food , it will not be worth it . yes , it is good , but i 've had better for cheaper . you would think they would make up for it with service , sadly , no . service was just ok , it is not what you 'd expect for $ 500 .

slightly above average wines start at $ 70+ with only one selection listed at $ 30+ .
DRINKS#PRICES
 first of all , this place is *not* romantic , as claimed by citysearch 's editorial review . either that , or the editor 's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th . the tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced . slightly above average wines start at $ 70+ with only one selection listed at $ 30+ . service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category . for instance , plates were just dumped on the table , i was handed the wine list upside down , etc ... . somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service . to be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora .

 i had my eyes on this place , promising myself i will one day 'give it a try . ' and i hate to say this but i doubt i 'll ever go back . the food is very average ... the thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet , every thing they serve is too sweet here . the only thing i moderately enjoyed was their grilled chicken special with edamame puree . i had never had edamame pureed before but i thought it was innovative and tasty ( could 've used a bit more salt ) . anyways , if you 're in the neighborhood to eat good food , i would n't waste my time trying to find something , rather go across the street to tamari . the decor is night tho ... but they really need to clean that vent in the ceiling ... its quite un-appetizing , and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern .

i took one bite from the $ 24 salmon , and i have never , in the 17 years i have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in flatbush farms .
FOOD#PRICES
 how is this palce still open ? i honestly do n't even know where to begin . my boyfriend and i are avid restaurant goers , and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended flatbush farms . we arrived and were seated immediately , which made us both happy . we ordered our appetizers , i ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon . everything was going good until we got our meals . i took one look at the chicken and i was appalled . it was served with skin , over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes . my boyfriend asked me if i wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead , while he de-skinned the chicken so that i could enjoy the white meat . i took one bite from the $ 24 salmon , and i have never , in the 17 years i have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in flatbush farms . at this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and did n't say anything , and guess what , the waitress walked away . so , i switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that i just could not bite through it . i could n't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach . i 've had better chicken at bbqs ! ! ! ! so i decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible . guess what , i waited for twenty minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , `` oh well , i wish you would have said something earlier '' no apology , nothing . after that she simply took our plates , walked away , came back another twenty minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! no desert menu , no apology , nothing ! ! ! ! ! ! i was literally going to explode , but instead , my boyfriend took the bill and went to find the manager . this is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she did n't like it , and i can not comp it . again , no apology , no is there anything else i can get you , no can i get you a drink to make up for it , nothing ! ! ! ! we refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore . the level of rudeness was preposterous . the manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out . i have never ever had such an unpleasant experience . this staff should be fired .

it was n't as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand , but now it 's simply repulsive .
RESTAURANT#GENERAL
 wretched and retching this will be only the third online review i have ever made about a restaurant in my life . they have all been tonight and they have all been about the same restaurant . i have never been so disgusted by both food an service . for starters they delivered us someone else 's order . fine , i wont hang you for that . however , once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it 's your only option ) , i got through about half my kimchee before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin . not one to jump to complaints ( hence my lack of previous online reviewing ) , i called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations . my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation . none was made so i hung up . less than three minutes passed before i found myself doubled over the toilet . my girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant . not only have i worked in restaurants for many years , i am now in culinary school , i am a huge lover of oysters and fish , and my girlfriend is half korean ! we know the difference between and oyster and bad fish . it was n't as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand , but now it 's simply repulsive . eat at your own risk .

 obviously the chinese translation of this place does not mean big wong , it actually means great prosperity . the food here does a great service to the name ( cantonese that is ... ) . i fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of bbq roast pork . this dish is my favorite and i always get it when i go there and never get tired of it . try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call ow ley soh , a delicious and sweet tasting bread . simply some good tasting chinese food at incredible prices ... service is not what you are coming here for ... just make sure my ice water is kept full and my tea kettle filled with piping hot tea and that 's all the service i need ... big wong is a great place to eat and fill your stomach .

 once you step into cosette , you 're miraculously in a small , off-the-beaten path parisian bistro . this tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets , with that certain parisian flair . the food was average to above-average ; the french onion soup filling yet not overly impressive , and the desserts not brilliant in any way . however , go for the ambience , and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world !

 how is this palce still open ? i honestly do n't even know where to begin . my boyfriend and i are avid restaurant goers , and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended flatbush farms . we arrived and were seated immediately , which made us both happy . we ordered our appetizers , i ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon . everything was going good until we got our meals . i took one look at the chicken and i was appalled . it was served with skin , over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes . my boyfriend asked me if i wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead , while he de-skinned the chicken so that i could enjoy the white meat . i took one bite from the $ 24 salmon , and i have never , in the 17 years i have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in flatbush farms . at this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and did n't say anything , and guess what , the waitress walked away . so , i switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that i just could not bite through it . i could n't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach . i 've had better chicken at bbqs ! ! ! ! so i decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible . guess what , i waited for twenty minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , `` oh well , i wish you would have said something earlier '' no apology , nothing . after that she simply took our plates , walked away , came back another twenty minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! no desert menu , no apology , nothing ! ! ! ! ! ! i was literally going to explode , but instead , my boyfriend took the bill and went to find the manager . this is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she did n't like it , and i can not comp it . again , no apology , no is there anything else i can get you , no can i get you a drink to make up for it , nothing ! ! ! ! we refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore . the level of rudeness was preposterous . the manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out . i have never ever had such an unpleasant experience . this staff should be fired .

 good experience during our trip to nyc , we made reservations to dine in the pool room of the four seasons for their pre-theater menu ( offering a modified menu for $ 65 pp ) . the wine list was extensive - though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings . the bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the `` free '' appetizer of olives was disappointing . however , our main course was wonderful . i had fish and my husband had the filet - both of which exceeded our expectations . the dessert ( we had a pear torte ) was good - but , once again , the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions . when we inquired about ports - the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost . not what i would expect for the price and prestige of this location . all in all , i would return - as it was a beautiful restaurant - but i hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future .

FOOD#QUALITY
 possibly the most romantic restaurant in the city this is undoubtedly my favorite modern japanese brasserie ( that don ’ t serve sushi ) , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city ! not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you ’ re no longer in the city . if you ’ re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you ’ ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching ( choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! ) . it ’ s just you and your date and an occasional cute ‘ excuse me ’ before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth ! my party had the bbe $ 29 fixe prix menu , which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake ! i never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it . we started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche . our first course was tuna sashimi with green yuzu sauce . i picked the grilled black cod as my entree , which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better . the entrees were served with miso soup and rice . the sake ’ s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world . for desserts , we tried the frozen black sesame mousse ( interesting but not extraordinary ) and matcha ( powdered green tea ) and blueberry cheesecake , which was phenomenal . maybe it was the great company ( i had friends visiting from philly – yes , it was not a date this time ) or the super reasonable price point , but i just can ’ t say enough good things about this brasserie . i don ’ t usually visit the same establishment more than once , what more twice , but i ’ ll come to zenkichi anytime for a quiet , unhurried and memorable dinner .

 planet thailand has always been a hit with me , i go there usually for the sushi , which is great , the thai food is excellent too . with the great variety on the menu , i eat here often and never get bored . the atmosphere is n't the greatest , but i suppose that 's how they keep the prices down . it 's all about the food ! !

 for authentic thai food , look no further than toons . ive been to many thai restaurants in manhattan before , and toons is by far the best thai food ive had ( except for my mom 's of course ) . try the pad thai , or sample anything on the appetizer menu ... they 're all delicious .

wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the uws !
SERVICE#GENERAL
 i live a block away and go to patsy 's frequently . the pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap , frozen , shredded cheese common to most pizzaria 's . two complaints- their appetizer selection stinks , it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu . also , because it is so thin , it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling . so eat fast and order a lot . wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the uws !

 never fails to please . delicious bagels , especially when right out of the oven . spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey . service is fast and friendly . only drawback - they wo n't toast your bagel , and they do n't make eggs for the bagel . but that is highly forgivable .

 indo chinese food , pretty good ... not a very fancy place but very good chinese style indian food . the chicken lollipop is my favorite , most of the dishes ( i have to agree with a previous reviewer ) are quite oily and very spicy , espeically the chilli chicken . my mom originally introduced me to this place , but even she ( being indian ) feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily . still we keep going back : )

the appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion ( maybe 3 of each ) .
FOOD#QUALITY
 do n't go with a larger group than 4 ! i went here for a family birthday dinner . five of us walked in at approximately 6:20 on a thursday evening . the hostess said `` wow that 's a large group , unless you are n't together '' , to which i replied `` no we are , and there will be one more , so a table for six please . '' at first we were a little taken aback , as this seemed to present a problem , although the restaurant looked fairly empty , but they hastily put the table together for us . the menu is fairly simple without much descriptions . there was no tap beer that evening , which was a disappointment . not much of a selection of bottled beer either , we went with brahma . the appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion ( maybe 3 of each ) . the lobster knuckles ( special of the day ) were ok , but pretty tasteless . i believe there were 2 shrimp in the `` salt encrusted shrimp '' appetizer . after we ate our appetizers ( which took all of 8 minutes ) we ordered another round of brahma 's - and tried to stall a little as we waited for our sixth dinner member . the waitress appeared and asked us if we wanted to go ahead and order . we replied that we would like to wait 5 more minutes if that was okay . she replied `` well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now , since you are a larger party , and it might get crowded . '' we called the other person who was very close by , and she told us to order for her , so we did . the food arrived in about 15 minutes . i had the thai style fried sea bass ... which was very good . everyone seemed generally happy with their food , except my brother who had the grilled mahi mahi , seemingly drenched in grapfruit juice ! i heard the lobster roll was excellent . they seemed to continue to rush us along , taking plates without asking if we were done ( my sister still had her fork in hand ) . all in all the food was good - a little on the expensive side , but fresh . service not the friendliest to our `` large party '' ! probably would not go back here .

vanison was good but not amazing .
FOOD#QUALITY
 there is `` expensive-but-worth-it '' and there is `` expensive-and-wtf '' ? this is a twenty-something guy that does n't mind laying down $ 300 for a fine and delicious meal for 2 on special occassions . but $ 500 for a dinner for two that did n't include wine ? are you freaking kidding me ? look , the appetizers were really good . the entree was also very good . ca n't argue about that , but they are clearly over priced . what you are paying for is the environment and the name . yes , the place is classy and beautiful , but they most certainly target the uber whealthy not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while . $ 500 included : drinks : 2 glasses of dom perignon at $ 35 each . starters : kobe beef sashimi . which of course is not real kobe but wagyu beef . surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as kobe . a beef consomme . entrees : vanison steak and bison steak . vanison was good but not amazing . bison was quite excellent however . dessert : pure disaster . just not good at all . some pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing not impressive at all . i read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and i thought to myself , but may be it is worth it . i was wrong . the four seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of new york city restaurants , but trust me , they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say `` i 've been to the four seasons restaurant '' . i wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly , curiousity got the best of me and i paid dearly for it . all in all , the food was great ( except for the dessserts ) . the environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts . if you are going for the food , it will not be worth it . yes , it is good , but i 've had better for cheaper . you would think they would make up for it with service , sadly , no . service was just ok , it is not what you 'd expect for $ 500 .

i agree that dining at casa la femme is like no other dining experience !
RESTAURANT#GENERAL
 terrible waste of money.. scammers i agree that dining at casa la femme is like no other dining experience ! but not in a good way . i am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience . i literally just got back home after visiting casa la femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time . we went to celebrate two birthdays and wanted to do something special and different . our visit their to say the least , was an unpleasant and costly experience ! and even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience . we did arrive late for our reservation so i can not complain too much about the wait for a table . although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes . we were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited . the place is beautiful ! the hostess was very pleasant . however , our $ 14 drinks were were horrible ! once we finally got a table , despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed ! since we were already waiting so long , we felt we had no other choice but to accept it . our experience did not ever get any better . for each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink . we also asked for hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hooka . after the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner . we asked for beverages and never received them . we asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order . my chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin . i would not expect this for a $ 55 dinner . by the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage nor hooka ! what we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka.. some of which we never received ! the only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses ! to top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant . by the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs and we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers ! if it seemed possible to do so while there i would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible ! i have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused , and wasted my hard earned money . my husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended ... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly ! i wish i could be refunded !

 bad staff i generally like this place . the food is good . the design of the space is good . but the service is horrid ! i was there for brunch recently , and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter . the waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand . i ca n't believe that it was , but please put the bag down before delivering food ! the waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating ( a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so i try to ignore it ) . i could n't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends , who was in mid bite , to clear the table . she then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables . i wish i could like this place more , and i wish someone would retrain the staff .

FOOD#QUALITY
 wretched and retching this will be only the third online review i have ever made about a restaurant in my life . they have all been tonight and they have all been about the same restaurant . i have never been so disgusted by both food an service . for starters they delivered us someone else 's order . fine , i wont hang you for that . however , once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it 's your only option ) , i got through about half my kimchee before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin . not one to jump to complaints ( hence my lack of previous online reviewing ) , i called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations . my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation . none was made so i hung up . less than three minutes passed before i found myself doubled over the toilet . my girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant . not only have i worked in restaurants for many years , i am now in culinary school , i am a huge lover of oysters and fish , and my girlfriend is half korean ! we know the difference between and oyster and bad fish . it was n't as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand , but now it 's simply repulsive . eat at your own risk .

( for those of you who do n't know , uni is sea urchin in japanese , which happens to be my favorite . ) he served me an uni hand roll , which i never had before , and let me tell you ... it was heaven ! aside from the sea urchin , the chef recommended an assortment of fish including fatty yellow tail , boton shrimp , blue fin torro ( fatty tuna ) , sea eel , etc . the sake menu should not be overlooked ! all in all , this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city . try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll .

DRINKS#STYLE_OPTIONS
 dumbfoundingly poor this was , from start to finish , a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience . lexicographers take note : a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in brooklyn . the servers at flatbush farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention . polite acknowledgement is out ; supercilious scorn is in . and how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins , inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent ? a different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) . overall the food quality was pretty good , though i hear the salmon is much better when it has n't sat cooling in front of the guest . the place has a nice fit-out , some attractive furnishings and , from what i could tell , a reasonable wine list ( i was given the food menu when i asked for the carte des vins ) at $ 120 for two people , however , this in no way represents value , unless you 're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture . on that scale , it 's a world-beater .

you ca n't go wrong with this place .
RESTAURANT#GENERAL
 as a retired hipster , i can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year lucky strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city . the wait staff is pleasant , fun , and for the most part gorgeous ( in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way , not in that she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b @ # $ * way ) . the food is yummy , especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries . but the best part about ls is the late night atmosphere , delightfully free of the bts . you can get a completely delish martini in a glass ( that 's about 2 1/2 drinks ) for $ 8.50 ( i recommend the vanilla shanty , mmmm ! ) in a great homey setting with great music . the in-house lady dj on saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music , and moreover , takes requests . you ca n't go wrong with this place .

FOOD#QUALITY
 i stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two fridays ago when i was with two friends in town from l.a . being serious sushi lovers , we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action . i asked the chef what he recommends and he asked me if i like uni . ( for those of you who do n't know , uni is sea urchin in japanese , which happens to be my favorite . ) he served me an uni hand roll , which i never had before , and let me tell you ... it was heaven ! aside from the sea urchin , the chef recommended an assortment of fish including fatty yellow tail , boton shrimp , blue fin torro ( fatty tuna ) , sea eel , etc . the sake menu should not be overlooked ! all in all , this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city . try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll .

the manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out .
SERVICE#GENERAL
 how is this palce still open ? i honestly do n't even know where to begin . my boyfriend and i are avid restaurant goers , and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended flatbush farms . we arrived and were seated immediately , which made us both happy . we ordered our appetizers , i ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon . everything was going good until we got our meals . i took one look at the chicken and i was appalled . it was served with skin , over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes . my boyfriend asked me if i wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead , while he de-skinned the chicken so that i could enjoy the white meat . i took one bite from the $ 24 salmon , and i have never , in the 17 years i have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in flatbush farms . at this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and did n't say anything , and guess what , the waitress walked away . so , i switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that i just could not bite through it . i could n't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach . i 've had better chicken at bbqs ! ! ! ! so i decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible . guess what , i waited for twenty minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , `` oh well , i wish you would have said something earlier '' no apology , nothing . after that she simply took our plates , walked away , came back another twenty minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! no desert menu , no apology , nothing ! ! ! ! ! ! i was literally going to explode , but instead , my boyfriend took the bill and went to find the manager . this is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she did n't like it , and i can not comp it . again , no apology , no is there anything else i can get you , no can i get you a drink to make up for it , nothing ! ! ! ! we refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore . the level of rudeness was preposterous . the manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out . i have never ever had such an unpleasant experience . this staff should be fired .
