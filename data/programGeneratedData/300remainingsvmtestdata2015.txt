reliable , fresh sushi
FOOD#QUALITY
 reliable , fresh sushi my husband and i take out from here 3-4 times a month . the sashimi is always fresh and the rolls are innovative and delicious . have never had a problem with service save a missing rice once . delivery can be spot on or lacking depending on the weather and the day of the week . delivery guy sometimes get upset if you do n't tip more than 10 % . we 've found it to be better and fresher than kiku which is comparable in price .

 not because you are `` the four seasons '' ... – you are allowed to charge an arm and a leg for a romatic dinner . the food was excellent as well as service , however , i left the four seasons very dissappointed . i do not think dinner in manhattan should cost $ 400.00 where i am not swept off my feet .
